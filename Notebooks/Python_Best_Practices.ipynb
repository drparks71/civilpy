    "### What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Executive summary from [python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/?external_link=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language  \n",
    "with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined  \n",
    "with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid  \n",
    "application development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language  \n",
    "to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn  \n",
    "syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program  \n",
    "maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program  \n",
    "modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive  \n",
    "standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for  \n",
    "all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The aspects of python that benefit engineers are that it has become  \n",
    "essentially ubiquitous, is included or installable in basically all  \n",
    "systems, and has essentially accomplished one of the Java programming  \n",
    "languages original major goals of \"write once, run anywhere\". Python works  \n",
    "via an interpreter that users \"send\" their code to for execution, similar  \n",
    "to executing VBA code by sending it to excel's VBA intrepreter. The primary  \n",
    "difference is that VBA operates exclusively within an application such as  \n",
    "excel, outlook or microstation, while python is generally operated  \n",
    "externally with the interpreter behaving as it's own stand-alone  \n",
    "application. The other major difference is that VBA is not open-source, so  \n",
    "without paying significant sums in licensing fees to Microsoft, we cannot  \n",
    "include the VBA interpreter itself within a deliverable application sent to  \n",
    "a client, and have to rely on whatever environment they're running having  \n",
    "access to the VBA intrepreter. This is generally taken as a given, but when  \n",
    "we consider the wide range of computing devices, and start including  \n",
    "devices such as cell phones, tablets, web-servers, IoT devices, sensors,  \n",
    "bridge control equipment or extreme cases like air-gapped control systems  \n",
    "for nuclear power plants. Access to Excel or even the internet is no longer  \n",
    "a given. In general, it is much easier to get python onto those kinds of  \n",
    "systems than it is to get excel onto them (from a technical standpoint if  \n",
    "not a bureaucratic one). Anything running any Linux, Mac or essentially any  \n",
    "of their derivative operating systems like Android or IoS, comes with very  \n",

    "to make it easier to add](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-the-windows-10-may-2019-update/). \n",
    "\n",

    "small amounts of resources. Due to it being open-source and able to be  \n",
    "embedded and shipped within software, many software development  \n",
    "organizations have shed support for VBA in favor for python and \"open\"  \n",
    "standards, like those that make up most of the internet such as SSH, HTTPS,  \n",
    "HTML, CSS, JSON and XML. This trend is expected to continue due to it's  \n",
    "downstream effect of lowering costs for end users. We have seen python  \n",

    "\n",
    "The majority of civil engineers will not find writing python code to be as  \n",
    "easy as developing an excel spreadsheet. The main reason for this, is  \n",
    "because the majority of civil engineers have been utilizing excel for most  \n",
    "of their life. Over the past 8 years, two trends have been developing;\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The number of applications embracing python as a scripting language is  \n",
    "rapidly expanding. As of writing, the following applications include python  \n",
    "interfaces to some degree,\n",
    "    - Microstation (2024+),\n",
    "    - MIDAS (NX only),\n",
    "    - Rhino 3D + Grasshopper,\n",
    "    - AllPlan,\n",
    "    - ArcGIS\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Additionally any application with a \"Restful API\" is accessible to  \n",
    "  python via the requests package. This includes essentially all web-based  \n",
    "  applications. Lastly a number of applications are basically advanced  \n",
    "  interfaces to a database (BrR) or output their results in a plain-text  \n",
    "  format (Merlin DASH) which both lend themselves to be able to be  \n",
    "  interfaced with easily by python.\n",
    "- The number of young engineers with at least a passing familiarity with  \n",
    "Python has been rapidly expanding. Many universities are teaching python as  \n",
    "a programming language because there are so many resources and tools  \n",
    "available for it. This has lead to a rapid growth in the number of users of  \n",
    "the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another net benefit is that code is unforgiving. Although this can  \n",
    "initially be seen as a negative, it is a positive. Consider this scenario,  \n",
    "an inexperienced engineer is attempting to solve a problem for which there  \n",
    "is a built out python package vs. a standardized excel sheet. Utilizing the  \n",
    "[pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library, the developer of the python package made their code unit  \n",
    "aware, meaning that inputs were given as `4 * units.feet`, rather than just  \n",
    "`4`. If the user plugged in the incorrect units into the excel sheet, like  \n",
    "`36` instead of `3` when the intended input was in feet, they would  \n",
    "generally still recieve a result. If the incorrect units are used as input  \n",
    "for a python function, the python function will either convert them to the  \n",
    "necessary unit, or raise an error if it's unable to be converted, python  \n",
    "will raise an error informing the user that the incorrect inputs were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other aspects of python force you into using additional \"Best practices\"  \n",
    "developed by and in use in the computer science industry for years. Things  \n",
    "like version control utilizing [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git), [test driven developemnt](https://testdriven.io/test-driven-development/), and [DRY  \n",
    "principles](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/DRY-principle) lend themselves well to developing an application in python,  \n",

    "indent are Baker's preferred style guidelines unless overriden within this  \n",

    "like IDEs and Black just naturally enforce Baker's preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users would benefit from implementing the following rulers in their jupyter  \n",
    "environments and other IDEs,\n",
    "\n",
    "ruler settings can be found under the \"settings\"->\"Settings Editor\", or by  \n",
    "typing <kbd>ctl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>. Within the settings editor select \"Notebook\", and scroll  \n",
    "down to \"Code Cell Configuration\" and \"Markdown Cell Configuration\" to  \n",
    "adjust these values. Note that these aren't bold in the settings menu,  \n",
    "and can be easy to miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "for \"Code Cells\" setting a ruler at 79 helps ensure compliance with  \n",

    "notebooks as pdfs when generating deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells should have a ruler set at 75. Rather than allowing the text  \n",
    "to wrap each line should end with a double space so the text presented to  \n",
    "the reader is less than 85 characters long. It should be noted that this  \n",
    "rule can be ignored for characters not displayed to the user, for instance,  \n",

    "## What Can Python Be Used For\n",
    "\n",
    "There's not a lot that python, like any turing-complete language, can't  \n",
    "accomplish. A better question is \"What **should** python be used for?\".  \n",
    "Going back to the second theme of this paper, **don't reinvent the wheel**.  \n",
    "Although a python application could be built out to perform FEA, there's  \n",
    "already an application readily available to all MB employees to do that via  \n",
    "MIDAS. A better use of an employees time, would be to develop the  \n",
    "customizations necessary for frequently performed tasks in MIDAS,  \n",
    "utilizing the MIDAS API. Basic simple \"verification calcs\" are easy enough  \n",
    "to write out in python and then be run on various documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced topics would be things like developing QA/QC tools that can  \n",
    "be given a pdf document and check certain things about it. For instance,  \n",
    "that any of the markups that have an attribute related to their current  \n",
    "status have all be toggled to \"closed\" indicating that all of the comments  \n",
    "have been addressed. This can speed up QA processes and help focus the  \n",
    "quality auditors time into areas that have a higher potential to contain  \n",
    "errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most complicated topics, include things like building full blown user  \n",
    "interfaces and things like developing customized machine learning  \n",
    "applications trained on MB data. This is where the development effort  \n",
    "starts to get beyond a sole developer and starts to get more into a team  \n",
    "based effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general it's better for code to be kept in a centralized location like  \n",
    "[github](https://github.com/) where the discussion and community effort required to go into  \n",
    "building advanced code bases can be stored alongside the code itself. The  \n",
    "intricacies of a version control system like git are beyond the scope of  \n",
    "this document, but more about it can be read [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-git/). One of the best ways to  \n",
    "reduce duplicative efforts, is to have an obvious place for users to look  \n",
    "first before engaging in that effort. If their same problem has already  \n",
    "been solved, this can save them significant amounts of time. If a similar  \n",
    "problem has been solved, they can help to expand that code base to address  \n",
    "the additional features they need."
