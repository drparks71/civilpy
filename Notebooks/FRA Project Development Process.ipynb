    "\n",
    "Goal is to take the 15% design from Service Planning and Environmental Review, and develop it to the 30% level of design with additional engineering.  The primary goals are to establish the project is feasible, and that the program requirements are fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the 30% design, the grantee will develop a schedule and cost estimate for the project. The FRA then reviews the Preliminary Engineering Package and provides technical assistance as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish the design criteria, infrastructure and operations, as well design drawings based on surveys, maps and existing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follows Service planning and conceptual engineering, Environmental Review is conducted concurrently with Preliminary Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preliminary Engineering is based on the preferred alternative identified during NEPA and Environmental Review is dependent on the Design drawings and supporting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "During NEPA, grantees assess reasonable alternatives for their environmental impacts among other factors. They use this analysis to select a preferred alternative. Only the preferred alternative is assessed during preliminary engineering. You may not submit your final PE package for approval until after the NEPA decision is issued and its results have been incorporated into PE.\n",
