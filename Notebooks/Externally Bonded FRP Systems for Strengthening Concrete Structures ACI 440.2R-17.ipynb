    "\n",
    "Sustainability of FRP materials may\n",
    "be evaluated considering environmental, economic, and\n",
    "social goals. These should be considered not only throughout\n",
    "the construction phase, but also through the service life\n",
    "of the structure in terms of maintenance and preservation,\n",
    "and for the end-of-life phase. This represents the basis for\n",
    "a life-cycle approach to sustainability (Menna et al. 2013).\n",
    "Life cycle assessment (LCA) takes into account the environmental\n",
    "impact of a product, starting with raw material\n",
    "extraction, followed by production, distribution, transportation,\n",
    "installation, use, and end of life. LCA for FRP composites\n",
    "depends on the product and market application, and\n",
    "results vary. FRP composite materials used to strengthen\n",
    "concrete elements can use both carbon fiber and glass fiber,\n",
    "which are derived from fossil fuels or minerals, respectively,\n",
    "and therefore have impacts related to raw material extraction.\n",
    "Although carbon and glass fibers have high embodied\n",
    "energies associated with production, on the order of 86,000\n",
    "Btu/lb and 8600 Btu/lb (200 and 20 mJ/kg), respectively\n",
    "(Howarth et al. 2014), the overall weight produced and used\n",
    "is orders of magnitude lower than steel (having embodied\n",
    "energy of 5600 Btu/lb [13 mJ/kg]), concrete (430 Btu/lb\n",
    "[1 mJ/kg]), and reinforcing steel (3870 Btu/lb [9 mJ/kg])\n",
    "(Griffin and Hsu 2010). The embodied energy and potential\n",
    "environmental impact of resin and adhesive systems are less\n",
    "studied, although the volume used is also small in comparison\n",
    "with conventional construction materials. In distribution\n",
    "and transportation, FRP composites’ lower weight leads to\n",
    "less impact from transportation, and easier material handling\n",
    "allows smaller equipment during installation. For installation\n",
    "and use, FRP composites are characterized as having a\n",
    "longer service life because they are more durable and require\n",
    "less maintenance than conventional materials. The end-oflife\n",
    "options for FRP composites are more complex.\n",

    "currently recycled, composites can be recycled in many\n",
    "ways, including mechanical grinding, incineration, and\n",
    "chemical separation (Howarth et al. 2014). It is difficult,\n",
    "however, to separate the materials, fibers, and resins without\n",
    "some degradation of the resulting recycled materials. The\n",
    "market for recycled composite materials is small, although\n",
    "aircraft manufacturers in particular are considering methods\n",
    "and programs to recycle and repurpose composite materials\n",
    "at the end of an aircraft’s life cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the FRP materials and systems, their use in\n",
    "the repair and retrofit of structures that may otherwise be\n",
    "decommissioned or demolished is inherently sustainable.\n",
    "In many cases, FRP composites permit extending the life or\n",
    "enhancing the safety or performance of existing infrastructure\n",
    "at a monetary and environmental cost of only a fraction\n",
    "of replacement. Additionally, due to the high specific\n",

    "Externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) systems have been used to strengthen and retrofit existing concrete structures around the world since the mid-1980s. The number of projects using FRP systems worldwide has increased dramatically, from a few in the 1980s to many thousands today. Structural elements strengthened with externally bonded FRP systems include beams, slabs, columns, walls, joints/connections, chimneys and smokestacks, vaults, domes, tunnels, silos, pipes, and trusses. Externally bonded FRP systems have also been used to strengthen masonry, timber, steel, and cast-iron structures. Externally bonded FRP systems were developed as alternatives to traditional external reinforcing techniques such as steel plate bonding and steel or concrete column jacketing. The initial development of externally bonded FRP systems for the retrofit of concrete structures occurred in the 1980s in Europe and Japan."

    "## 3.1 — Historical development\n",
    "\n",
    "In Europe, FRP systems were developed as alternates to steel plate bonding. Bonding steel plates to the tension zones of concrete members with adhesive resins was shown to be a viable technique for increasing flexural strength (Fleming and King 1967). This technique has been used to strengthen many bridges and buildings around the world. Because steel plates can corrode, leading to a deterioration of the bond between the steel and concrete, and because they are difficult to install, requiring the use of heavy equipment, researchers looked to FRP materials as an alternative to steel. Experimental work using FRP materials for retrofitting concrete structures was reported as early as 1978 in Germany (Wolf and Miessler 1989). Research in Switzerland led to the first applications of externally bonded FRP systems to reinforced concrete bridges for flexural strengthening (Meier 1987; Rostasy 1987).\n",
    "\n",
    "FRP systems were first applied to reinforced concrete columns for providing additional confinement in Japan in the 1980s (Fardis and Khalili 1981; Katsumata et al. 1987). A sudden increase in the use of FRPs in Japan was observed following the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake (Nanni 1995).\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers in the United States have had a continuous interest in fiber-based reinforcement for concrete structures since the 1930s. Development and research into the use of these materials for retrofitting concrete structures, however, started in the 1980s through the initiatives of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The research activities led to the construction of many field projects that encompassed a wide variety of environmental conditions. Previous research and field applications for FRP rehabilitation and strengthening are described in ACI 440R and conference proceedings, including those of the Fiber Reinforced Polymers for Reinforced Concrete Structures (FRPRCS), Composites in Civil Engineering (CICE), and Conference on Durability of Composites for Construction (CDCC) series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of codes and standards for externally bonded FRP systems is ongoing in Europe, Japan, Canada, and the United States. The first published codes and standards appeared in Japan (Japan Society of Civil Engineers 2001) and Europe (International Federation for Structural Concrete 2001). In the United States, ACI 440.8, ICC AC125, and NCHRP Report 655 (Zureick et al. 2010) provide criteria for evaluating FRP systems."

    "Wet layup FRP systems consist of dry unidirectional or multidirectional fiber sheets or fabrics impregnated with a saturating resin on site. The saturating resin, along with the compatible primer and putty, bonds the FRP sheets to the concrete surface. Wet layup systems are saturated on site and cured in place and, in this sense, are analogous to cast-in-place concrete. Three common types of wet layup systems are listed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dry unidirectional fiber sheets where the fibers run predominantly in one planar direction. ACI 440.8 provides specifications for unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) wet layup systems.\n",

Prepreg systems are bonded to the concrete surface with or without an additional resin application, depending on specific system requirements. Prepreg systems are saturated off site and, like wet layup systems, cured in place. Prepreg systems usually require additional heating for curing. Prepreg system manufacturers should be consulted for storage and shelf-life recommendations and curing procedures. Three common types of prepreg FRP systems are:\n",

Certain types of vinylester resins have higher ultraviolet light durability than epoxy resins.\n",
    "1. Fire protection—Fire protection systems are discussed in 1.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.\n",
    "1. Vandalism—Protective systems that are to resist vandalism should be hard and durable. There are different levels of vandalism protection, ranging from polyurethane coatings that will resist cutting and scraping to cementitious overlays that provide greater protection.\n",
    "1. Impact, abrasion, and wear—Protection systems for impact, abrasion, and wear are similar to those used for vandalism protection; however, abrasion and wear are different than vandalism in that they result from repeated exposure rather than a one-time event, and their protection systems are usually chosen for their hardness and durability.\n",
    "1. Aesthetics—Protective topcoats may be used to conceal the FRP system. These may be acrylic latex coatings that are gray in color to match concrete, or they may be various other colors and textures to match the existing structure.\n",
    "1. Chemical resistance—Exposure to harsh chemicals, such as strong acids, may damage the FRP system. In such environments, coatings with better chemical resistance, such as urethanes and novolac epoxies, may be used.\n",
    "1. Submersion in potable water—In applications where the FRP system is to be submerged in potable water, the FRP system may leach compounds into the water supply. Protective coatings that do not leach harmful chemicals into the water may be used as a barrier between the FRP system and the potable water supply."

    "Above the glass transition temperature Tg, the elastic modulus of a polymer is significantly reduced due to changes in its molecular structure. The value of Tg depends on the type of resin and is normally in the region of 140 to 180°F (60 to 82°C). In an FRP composite material, the fibers, which exhibit better thermal properties than the resin, can continue to support some load in the longitudinal direction until the temperature threshold of the fibers is reached. This can occur at temperatures exceeding 1800°F (1000°C) for carbon fibers, 530°F (275°C) for glass fibers, and 350°F (175°C) for aramid fibers. Due to a reduction in force transfer between fibers through bond to the resin, however, the tensile properties of the overall composite are reduced. Test results have indicated that temperatures of 480°F (250°C)—much higher than the resin $T_g$—will reduce the tensile strength of GFRP and CFRP materials exceeding 20 percent (Kumahara et al. 1993). Other properties affected by the shear transfer through the resin, such as bending strength, are reduced significantly at lower temperatures (Wang and Evans 1995).\n",
    "\n",
    "For bond-critical applications of FRP systems, the properties of the polymer at the fiber-concrete interface are essential in maintaining the bond between FRP and concrete. At a temperature close to its $T_g$, the mechanical properties of the polymer are significantly reduced and the polymer begins to lose its ability to transfer stresses from the concrete to the fibers."

    "The tensile behavior of FRP materials consisting of a single type of fiber material is characterized by a linear elastic stressstrain relationship until failure, which is sudden and brittle. The tensile strength and stiffness of an FRP material is dependent on several factors. Because the fibers in an FRP material are the main load-carrying constituents, the type of fiber, the orientation of fibers, the quantity of fibers, and method and conditions in which the composite is produced affect the tensile properties of the FRP material. Due to the primary role of the fibers and methods of application, the properties of an FRP repair system are sometimes reported based on the net-fiber area. In other instances, such as in precured laminates, the reported properties are based on the gross-laminate area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gross-laminate area of an FRP system is calculated using the total cross-sectional area of the cured FRP system, including all fibers and resin. The gross-laminate area is typically used for reporting precured laminate properties where the cured thickness is constant and the relative proportion of fiber and resin is controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net-fiber area of an FRP system is calculated using the known area of fiber, neglecting the total width and thickness of the cured system; thus, resin is excluded. The netfiber area is typically used for reporting properties of wet layup systems that use manufactured fiber sheets and fieldinstalled resins. The wet layup installation process leads to controlled fiber content and variable resin content. A method similar to net-fiber area reporting is to report the tensile force or stiffness per unit width of the FRP system as required by ASTM D7565/D7565M.\n",
    "\n",
    "System properties reported using the gross laminate area have higher relative thickness dimensions and lower relative strength and modulus values, whereas system properties reported using the net-fiber area have lower relative thickness dimensions and higher relative strength and modulus values. Regardless of the basis for the reported values, the load-carrying strength ($f_{fu}A_f$) and axial stiffness ($A_fE_f$) of the composite remain constant. Properties reported based on the net-fiber area are not the properties of the bare fibers. When tested as a part of a cured composite, the measured tensile strength and ultimate rupture strain of the net-fiber are typically lower than those measured based on a dry fiber test. The properties of an FRP system should be characterized as a composite, recognizing not just the material properties of the individual fibers, but also the efficiency of the fiberresin system, the fabric architecture, and the method used to create the composite. The mechanical properties of all FRP systems, regardless of form, should be based on the testing of laminate samples with known fiber content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tensile properties of some commercially available FRP strengthening systems are given in Appendix A. The tensile properties of a particular FRP system, however, should be obtained from the FRP system manufacturer or using the appropriate test method described in ASTM D3039/D3039M, D7205/D7205M, or D7565/D7565M. Manufacturers should report an ultimate tensile strength, which is defined as the mean tensile strength of a sample of test specimens minus three times the standard deviation ($f^*_{fu}=f_{fu} – 3\\sigma$) and, similarly, report an ultimate rupture strain ($\\epsilon f^*_u=f_u – 3\\sigma$). This approach provides a 99.87 percent probability that the actual ultimate tensile properties will exceed these statistically-based design values for a standard sample distribution (Mutsuyoshi et al. 1990). The elastic modulus should be calculated in accordance with ASTM D3039/D3039M, D7205/D7205M, or D7565/D7565M. A minimum number of 20 replicate test specimens should be used to determine the ultimate tensile properties. The manufacturer should provide a description of the method used to obtain the reported tensile properties, including the number of tests, mean values, and standard deviations."

    "\n",
    "Externally bonded FRP systems should not be used as compression reinforcement due to insufficient testing to validate its use in this type of application. The mode of failure for FRP laminates subjected to longitudinal compression can include transverse tensile failure, fiber microbuckling, or shear failure. The mode of failure depends on the type of fiber, the fiber-volume fraction, and the type of resin. In general, compressive strengths are higher for materials with higher tensile strengths, except in the case of aramid FRP (AFRP), where the fibers exhibit nonlinear behavior in compression at a relatively low level of stress (Wu 1990). The compressive modulus of elasticity is usually smaller than the tensile modulus of elasticity of FRP materials (Ehsani 1993)."

    "### 4.4.1 - Creep rupture\n",
    "\n",
    "FRP materials subjected to a sustained load can suddenly fail after a time period referred to as the endurance time. This type of failure is known as creep rupture. As the ratio of the sustained tensile stress to the short-term strength of the FRP laminate increases, endurance time decreases. The endurance time also decreases under adverse environmental conditions, such as high temperature, ultraviolet-radiation exposure, high alkalinity, wet and dry cycles, or freezing-and-thawing cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, carbon fibers are the least susceptible to creep rupture, aramid fibers are moderately susceptible, and glass fibers are most susceptible. Creep rupture tests have been conducted on 0.25 in. (6 mm) diameter FRP bars reinforced with glass, aramid, and carbon fibers. The FRP bars were tested at different load levels at room temperature. Results indicated that a linear relationship exists between creep rupture strength and the logarithm of time for all load levels. The ratios of stress to cause creep rupture after 500,000 hours (approximately 50 years) to the short-term ultimate strength of the GFRP, AFRP, and CFRP bars were extrapolated to be approximately 0.3, 0.5, and 0.9, respectively (Yamaguchi et al. 1997; Malvar 1998). Recommendations on sustained stress limits imposed to avoid creep rupture are given Chapter 9 through 15. As long as the sustained stress in the FRP is below the creep rupture stress limits, the strength of the FRP is available for nonsustained loads."

    "### 4.4.2 - Fatigue\n",
    "\n",
    "A substantial amount of data for fatigue behavior and life prediction of stand-alone FRP materials is available (National Research Council 1991). Most of these data were generated from materials typically used by the aerospace industry. Despite the differences in quality and consistency between aerospace and commercial-grade FRP materials, some general observations on the fatigue behavior of FRP materials can be made. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the following cases are based on a unidirectional material with approximately 60 percent fiber-volume fraction and subjected to tension-tension sinusoidal cyclic loading at:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A frequency low enough to not cause self heating\n",
    "1. Ambient laboratory environments\n",
    "1. A stress ratio (ratio of minimum applied stress to maximum applied stress) of 0.1\n",
    "1. A direction parallel to the principal fiber alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Test conditions that raise the temperature and moisture content of FRP materials generally degrade the ambient environment fatigue behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all types of FRP composites for infrastructure applications, CFRP is the least prone to fatigue failure. An endurance limit of 60 to 70 percent of the initial static ultimate strength of CFRP is typical. On a plot of stress versus the logarithm of the number of cycles at failure (S-N curve), the downward slope for CFRP is usually approximately 5 percent of the initial static ultimate strength per decade of logarithmic life (Curtis 1989). At 1 million cycles, the fatigue strength is generally between 60 and 70 percent of the initial static ultimate strength and is relatively unaffected by the moisture and temperature exposures of concrete structures unless the resin or fiber/resin interface is substantially degraded by the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ambient-environment laboratory tests (Mandell and Meier 1983), individual glass fibers demonstrated delayed rupture caused by stress corrosion, which had been induced by the growth of surface flaws in the presence of even minute quantities of moisture. When many glass fibers were embedded into a matrix to form an FRP composite, a cyclic tensile fatigue effect of approximately 10 percent loss in the initial static strength per decade of logarithmic lifetime was observed (Mandell 1982). This fatigue effect is thought to be due to fiber-fiber interactions and is not dependent on the stress corrosion mechanism described for individual fibers. Usually, no clear fatigue limit can be defined. Environmental factors can play an important role in the fatigue behavior of glass fibers due to their susceptibility to moisture, alkaline, or acidic solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aramid fibers, for which substantial durability data are available, appear to behave reasonably well in fatigue. Neglecting in this context the rather poor durability of all aramid fibers in compression, the tension-tension fatigue behavior of an impregnated aramid fiber strand is excellent. Strength degradation per decade of logarithmic lifetime is approximately 5 to 6 percent (Roylance and Roylance 1981). While no distinct endurance limit is known for AFRP, 2-million-cycle endurance limits of commercial AFRP tendons for concrete applications have been reported in the range of 54 to 73 percent of the ultimate tensile strength (Odagiri et al. 1997). Because the slope of the applied stress versus logarithmic endurance time of AFRP is similar to the slope of the stress versus logarithmic cyclic lifetime data, the individual fibers appear to fail by a strain-limited creep rupture process. This lifetime limiting mechanism in commercial AFRP bars is accelerated by exposure to moisture and elevated temperature (Roylance and Roylance 1981; Rostasy 1997)."

These factors are discussed in more detail in 9.3.

    "The FRP system installation contractor should demonstrate competency for surface preparation and application of the FRP system to be installed. Contractor competency can be demonstrated by providing evidence of training and documentation of related work previously completed by the contractor or by actual surface preparation and installation of the FRP system on portions of the structure. The FRP system manufacturer or its authorized agent should train the contractor’s application personnel in the installation procedures of its system and ensure they are competent to install the system."

    "## 6.2 - Temperature, humidity, and moisture considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature, relative humidity, and surface moisture at the time of installation can affect the performance of the FRP system. Conditions to be observed before and during installation include surface temperature and moisture condition of the concrete, air temperature, relative humidity, and corresponding dew point. Primers, saturating resins, and adhesives should generally not be applied to cold or frozen surfaces. When the surface temperature of the concrete surface falls below a minimum level as specified by the FRP system manufacturer, improper saturation of the fibers and improper curing of the resin constituent materials can occur, compromising the integrity of the FRP system. An auxiliary heat source can be used to raise the ambient and surface temperature during installation and maintain proper temperatures during curing. The heat source should be clean and not contaminate the surface or the uncured FRP system. Resins and adhesives should generally not be applied to damp or wet surfaces unless they have been formulated for such applications. FRP systems should not be applied to concrete surfaces that are subject to moisture vapor transmission. The transmission of moisture vapor from a concrete surface through the uncured resin materials typically appears as surface bubbles and can compromise the bond between the FRP system and the substrate."

    "Surface preparation for bond-critical applications should be in accordance with recommendations of ACI 546R and ICRI 310.2R. The concrete or repaired surfaces to which the FRP system is to be applied should be freshly exposed and free of loose or unsound materials. Where fibers wrap around corners, the corners should be rounded to a minimum 0.5 in. (13 mm) radius to reduce stress concentrations in the FRP system and voids between the FRP system and the concrete. Roughened corners should be smoothed with putty. Obstructions, inside corners, concave surfaces, and embedded objects can affect the performance of the FRP system and should be addressed. Obstructions and embedded objects may need to be removed before installing the FRP system. Inside corners and concave surfaces may require special detailing to ensure that the bond of the FRP system to the substrate is maintained. Surface preparation can be accomplished using abrasive or water-blasting techniques. All laitance, dust, dirt, oil, curing compound, existing coatings, and any other matter that could interfere with the bond of the FRP system to the concrete should be removed. Bug holes and other small surface voids should be completely exposed during surface profiling. After the profiling operations are complete, the surface should be cleaned and protected before FRP installation so that no materials that can interfere with bond are redeposited on the surface.\n",

    "The concrete surface should be prepared to a surface profile not less than CSP 3, as defined by ICRI 310.2R or to the tolerances recommended by the FRP system manufacturer. Localized out-of-plane variations, including form lines, should not exceed 1/32 in. (1 mm) or the tolerances recommended by the FRP system manufacturer. Localized out-of-plane variations can be removed by grinding, before abrasive or water blasting, or can be smoothed over using resin-based putty if the variations are very small. Bug holes and voids should be filled with resin-based putty.\n",
