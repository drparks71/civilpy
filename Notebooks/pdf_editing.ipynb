      "A significant number of masonry arch bridges were built during the mid-to-late 19th century on \n",
      "the railroad systems of the Northeastern United States.  The oldest in the United States is the \n",

      "Some of these bridges are still carrying a substantial railroad load without any major distress, but \n",
      "some arch bridges are required to be rated for a posting limit. \n",

      "Many researchers including Boothby (2001) and Fanning (2002) have analyzed a number of \n",
      "existing masonry arch bridges using computer programs and have compared the results to field \n",
      "measurements.  Since their computer analyses results are very compatible to the field-testing, the \n",
      "elastic frame analysis method is validated.  Therefore, it is now possible to predict the behavior \n",
      "of arch structures with greater confidence using a simplified frame model of the structure with a \n",
      "commercially available structural analysis program such as LARSA or STAAD.  However, their \n",
      "methods have presented a few unsolved inconsistencies such as the eccentricity that escapes the \n",
      "arch ring thickness yet the bridges in measurement showed no significant signs of overstress.  \n",
      "Boothby suggested using a moment (M) and axial thrust (P) envelope to rate the arch bridges.  It \n",
      "is also difficult to apply this envelope to the load rating without going through repeated computer \n",

      "are semi-empirical methods such as the MEXE (Military Engineering Experimental \n",

      "quickly access the capacity of arch bridges for military vehicles.  Since the MEXE procedure \n",
      "yields too conservative results, the mechanism method was developed in the early 80’s.  This \n",
      "collapse mechanism method yields better results than the MEXE method, but still poses some \n",

      " \n",
      "1. It allows the axial thrust to escape the arch ring thickness in a certain location where the \n",

      "CSXT Bridge No. 10A is located at Mile Post BAA9.1, Baltimore Division, Capital Subdivision, \n",
      "near Relay, Baltimore County, Maryland, better known as The Thomas Viaduct.  The Thomas \n",
      "Viaduct is an eight-span, stone masonry arch bridge traversing the Patapsco River Valley located \n",
      "between the towns of Relay and Elkridge, Maryland.  The viaduct has an overall length of 704’- \n",
      "10” including the approaches.  There are a total of 8 arches with each span measuring 67’- 6” in \n",
      "lengths center-to-center of piers.  The width of the arch is 26’- 4”.  The structure was built on a \n",

      "structure at the arch crown is 3’- 6” and the depth of structure at the spring line is 32’-0”.  The \n",
      "viaduct face consists of roughly cut dense granite with a ring thickness of 2’-6”.  The photo in \n",

      "Geometry \n",
      "Since the original bridge drawings were not available, the bridge dimensions are based on a 1937 \n",
      "bridge repair plan sheet.  The shape of all eight arches is the same and therefore an arch span is \n",
      "selected for the load rating analysis. The arch ring is first divided into 20 segments with each \n",

      "A horizontal elastic spring is assigned to represent a more realistic elastic behavior at each \n",
      "support.  As recommended in Table 1, a spring constant of 8,700 kip/in./ft was chosen and \n",
      "applied at each supports, which are nodal points 1 and 21 as shown in Figure 11.  To account for \n",
      "the passive resistance of the fill as the outer third of arch ring deflects into the fill, soil springs \n",
      "are assigned to nodal points 2, 3, 4, 18, 19 and 20 as described in Section 4.2.1.  The direction of \n",
      "spring should be normal to the arch ring; however, this procedure requires very complex \n",

      "Elastic frame analysis modeling for a unit width of the arch ring of a masonry arch bridge \n",
      "provides a sufficiently quick, simple and reasonably precise means of rating the load carrying \n",
      "capacity of  masonry and reinforced concrete arch bridges.  The use of average material strength \n",
      "and stiffness constants based on the analysis of previous field test data by Boothby (2001, 2004) \n",
      "makes it possible to predict the behavior of a masonry arch bridge to within sufficient accuracy \n",
      "of load rating analysis.  The field test results compared with the procedures developed by \n",
      "Boothby, et al. (2002) legitimize the use of elastic frame analysis for the load rating of masonry \n",
      "arches.  However, a few mysteries were still yet to be answered.  The new features in this paper \n",
